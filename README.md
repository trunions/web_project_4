**Intro**

This project was an introduction to Javascript. I created a profile using HTML and CSS. A pop up was created using a mixture of all three. The pop up will come up when you push the edit button. You can edit the information and close the pop up using either the close or save buttons.  

My project can be found at: https://trunions.github.io/web_project_4/.

**Tech Used**

 I used Figma and Visual Studio to complete this project. I was able to use techniques like psuedo rules and different display styles like flexbox and grid. I was able to use basic javascript to make the page interactive with a pop up window. 

**Plans for Finalizing Project**

 I'll be changing anything I need to to pass my code review. stayed tuned!
