**Intro**

This project was an introduction to Javascript. I created a profile using HTML and CSS. A pop up was created using a mixture of all three. The pop up will come up when you push the edit button. You can edit the information and close the pop up using either the close or save buttons.  

My project can be found at: https://trunions.github.io/web_project_4/.

**Tech Used**

 I used Figma and Visual Studio to complete this project. I was able to use techniques like psuedo rules and different display styles like flexbox and grid. I was able to use basic javascript to make the page interactive with a pop up window. 

**Plans for Finalizing Project**

 I'll be changing anything I need to to pass my code review. stayed tuned! 

 11/07/2020: I cleaned up my code to make it easier to read and to function better. I changed some styling to work better with the page. 

 11/09/2020: I made my page reactive to the width of the page. The layout should now not break as the page is made smaller. I also fixed some margins in the pop up page and profile block. 

 11/10/2020: I cleaned up my code further and fixed some layout breaks on certain screen widths.
