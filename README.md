**Intro**

This project is a continuation of Projects 4 and 5. In this project, I learned about validating forms using Javascript. The text fields in the pop up windows will give an error if the input is to short, wrong, or non-existent. The "Save" and "Create" buttons are disabled unless the text fields are filled in correctly. You can either click outside of the pop up or push the "Escape" key to close the pop ups. 

My project can be found at: https://trunions.github.io/web_project_4/.

**Tech Used**

 I used Figma and Visual Studio to complete this project. I was able to use techniques like psuedo rules and different display styles like flexbox and grid. I used this project to practice validating my forms using javascrips. 

**Plans for Finalizing Project**

 I'll be changing anything I need to to pass my code review. stayed tuned!
