**Intro**

This project is a continuation of my last project. This time, I added two other pop up windows. One will allow you to add additional cards to the page. The other will give you a better view of the pictures. You can also delete a card and favorite a card. 

My project can be found at: https://trunions.github.io/web_project_4/.

**Tech Used**

 I used Figma and Visual Studio to complete this project. I was able to use techniques like psuedo rules and different display styles like flexbox and grid. I used this project to help concrete my javascript skills.

**Plans for Finalizing Project**

 I'll be changing anything I need to to pass my code review. stayed tuned!
